An app for planning pub crawls and mobile parties.

With Gulp you'll be able to create trails that have a start time and any number of stops. The stops can be bars, restaurants or outdoor locations marked by Latitude and Longitude.

When planning a trail, you'll be able to locate previous stops used by your friends on their trails. You can plan your route and enter it all into Gulp, secure in the knowledge that the information won't be public until the start time.
